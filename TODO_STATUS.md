# TODO Status Report

## ✅ COMPLETED

### 1. ✅ Role-based navigation in sidebar

**Status**: Already implemented!  
**Location**: `src/lib/constants/index.ts`  
**Function**: `getNavigationItems(hostname, role)`

**How it works**:

- Returns different navigation arrays based on role
- Admin gets `ADMIN_NAVIGATION_ITEMS` (8 items)
- Teacher gets `TEACHER_NAVIGATION_ITEMS` (6 items)
- Student gets `STUDENT_NAVIGATION_ITEMS` (6 items)

**Proof**: Lines 260-305 in constants/index.ts

## ❌ NOT DONE YET

### 2. ❌ Shared course list page

**Status**: Still duplicated  
**Files**:

- `src/app/admin/courses/page.tsx` (~452 lines)
- `src/app/teacher/courses/page.tsx` (~550 lines)

**Similarities**: 90%+ duplicated code

- Same imports
- Same filtering logic
- Same UI components
- Same modals

**Differences**:

- Different base path (admin vs teacher)
- Admin can delete/edit all courses
- Teacher may have limited permissions

**Action needed**: Create `src/components/courses/course-list-page.tsx` (shared component)

---

### 3. ❌ Expand to other duplicated pages

**Status**: Not started  
**Pages that likely need unification**:

- Users management (`/admin/users` vs `/teacher/users`?)
- Analytics (`/admin/analytics` vs `/teacher/analytics`?)
- Dashboard (partial duplication)
- Others: Check manually

**Action needed**:

1. Identify duplicated pages
2. Create shared components
3. Refactor existing pages

---

### 4. ⚠️ Testing for role behavior

**Status**: Partially done  
**Done**:

- ✅ Created testing guide (`ROLE_BASED_TESTING_GUIDE.md`)
- ✅ Documented test scenarios

**Not done**:

- ❌ No actual tests run
- ❌ No automated tests written
- ❌ No CI/CD integration

**Action needed**: Write and run tests

## 🎯 Recommendations

### Immediate Priority

1. **Unify course list pages** (High impact, low effort)
   - Apply same pattern as course detail
   - Expected: 800 lines → 600 lines
   - Similar work as done before

### Medium Priority

2. **Identify other duplicates**
   - Review `/admin/*` and `/teacher/*` pages
   - Check for similar patterns
   - Create backlog of items to unify

### Low Priority

3. **Add automated tests**
   - Unit tests for shared components
   - Integration tests for role behavior
   - E2E tests for critical flows

## 💡 Next Steps

1. Should I unify the course list pages now? ⚡
2. Should I scan for other duplicates first? 🔍
3. Should I write tests for existing code? 🧪

Let me know what you want to tackle next!
